## Getting Started

You just learned about indexing data frames, and you will see this applied quite often in R. However, one downside of indexing data frames in R is that the code is hard to interpret. Let's just take a look at the code snippet below:

    top_performers <- course_records[
      rowSums(course_records[, c("Week.1.Attendance", "Week.2.Attendance", "Week.3.Attendance", "Week.4.Attendance", "Week.5.Attendance")]) >= 4 & 
      course_records[, "Post.Assessment.Score"] - course_records[, "Pre.Assessment.Score"] > 0 & 
      course_records[, "Post.Assessment.Score"] >= 0.8, 
      "Name"
    ]

    top_performers

Based on the code above, it's hard to tell who's included in `top_performers`. Thankfully, there's a newer approach to doing this same task. Let's see what it looks like.

    course_records <- course_records %>%
      mutate(
        total_attendance = Week.1.Attendance + Week.2.Attendance + Week3.Attendance + Week.4.Attendance + Week.5.Attendance,
        assessment_improvement = Post.Assessment.Score - Pre.Assessment.Score
      ) 
      
    top_performers <- course_records %>%
      filter(
        total_attendance >= 4 &
        assessment_improvement > 0 &
        Post.Assessment.Score >= 0.8
      ) %>%
      select(Name)

    top_performers

Based on the code snippet above, it is much easier to figure out the top performers consist of students who:

-   Attended class at least 4 times (`total_attendance >= 4`).

-   Improved their assessment score (`assessment_improvement > 0`).

-   Scored at least 80 percent on their post assessment (`Post.Assessment.Score >= 0.8`)

The second code snippet is easier to read because it uses the Tidyverse!

## The Tidyverse

According to its creators, the **Tidyverse** is a set of R packages that:

["facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data."](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/vignettes/paper.html)

In other words, code created from the Tidyverse was designed to be easier to read. It provides a way to more closely align your code with the way you would describe your analysis.

Let's take a look at the Tidyverse code snippet again:

    course_records <- course_records %>%
      mutate(
        total_attendance = Week.1.Attendance + Week.2.Attendance + Week3.Attendance + Week.4.Attendance + Week.5.Attendance,
        assessment_improvement = Post.Assessment.Score - Pre.Assessment.Score
      ) 
      
    top_performers <- course_records %>%
      filter(
        total_attendance >= 4 &
        assessment_improvement > 0 &
        Post.Assessment.Score >= 0.8
      ) %>%
      select(Name)

    top_performers

Notice how even though you haven't learned about `%>%`, `mutate`, `filter`, and `select`, you are able to reasonably guess their functionality.

## Knowledge Check

Take a look at the code snippet and answer the question:

    library(tidyverse)

    prescriptions_df <- prescriptions_df[
      prescriptions_df$RXDUSE == 1,
      c("SEQN", "RXDDRUG")
    ]

```{r KC-1, echo=FALSE}
question("TRUE or FALSE: The code snippet above is using the Tidyverse approach.",
  answer("TRUE ", message = "Not quite. This was a trick question! Even though we loaded the tidyverse package, using square brackets to index data frames is the traditional or base R approach."),
  answer("FALSE ", correct = TRUE, message = "That's right!"),
  type="single",
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```
